# SudokuVisualizer
Developed an interactive Sudoku visualizer with real-time input validation, hint functionality, and solver feature using Java Swing to enhance user engagement and experience.
• Implemented real-time input validation for user entries in the Sudoku grid, changing the cell color to red for invalid inputs and yellow for valid inputs.
• Integrated a hint functionality to assist users by providing valid hints that lead to a solution, improving the overall usability.
• Designed a reset feature to restore the Sudoku grid to its initial state while maintaining the color coding of pre-filled cells.
• Created a solver feature using a background worker thread to solve the Sudoku puzzle with visual updates, ensuring a smooth user interface without blocking the main thread.
• Added control buttons (Solve, Hint, Reset, Stop, Exit) for enhanced game control, including a Stop button to cancel the solving process, improving user control and flexibility.
• Optimized the input validation logic to ensure only valid entries (numbers 1-9) are accepted, enhancing data integrity and user experience.
• Utilized Java Swing for the graphical user interface, providing a responsive and interactive user experience.
